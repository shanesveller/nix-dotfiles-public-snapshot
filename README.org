#+STARTUP: content

* TODO Shane Sveller's Personal Dotfiles
More instructions/descriptive content possibly forthcoming.

*This repository is an incomplete capture of my real Git history* and has been
cleaned, and almost certainly does not build or evaluate correctly at any given
time due to the redacted content.

** Folder structure
Still in flux and there are several things I'd like to consolidate and reorganize.

- ~config~ :: special-snowflake content for ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME~ that must remain mutable
  - Currently just my Doom Emacs config, which is literate org-mode but not particularly clever
- ~darwin~ :: MacOS specific content for ~nix-darwin~
- ~flake-parts~ :: submodules/content for [[https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts][flake-parts]]
- ~machines~ :: entrypoints for NixOS/~nix-darwin~ and [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/][home-manager]] content
- ~modules~ :: predominantly ~home-manager~ modules and a small amount of NixOS content for ~bspwm~ (~nixos~ folder is intended to collapse into this)
- ~nix~ :: sort of orphaned, but was meant to hold Nix content that was not specific to either flakes or ~flake-parts~
- ~nixos~ :: NixOS modules and "profiles" (my nickname for i.e. desktop vs headless presets)
- ~pkgs~ :: local derivations that are typically exposed as flake outputs

** Machines
- Heimdall :: Ryzen 5950X/Radeon 6900XT desktop running NixOS 22.05
- Kvasir :: 2018 Intel Macbook Pro running MacOS 11
- Lodurr :: 2021 M1 Macbook Pro running MacOS 12, issued by my employer
- Yggdrasil :: Intel Skull Canyon NUC (~NUC6i7KYK~) running NixOS 22.05
